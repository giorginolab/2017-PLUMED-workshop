Markov models
  Suitable for large scale dynamics
  Examples of successful cases
  

MM Workflow
  Start in an arbitrary space, high dimensional <--- This is what Plumed addressess well
    In a sense, MM has points in common with metadynamics in the treatment of internal dofs
    One difference is that one does not need to resimulate, just re-evalute
    (Partial exception when doing adaptive)
  Reduce dimension with tICA
  Cluster
  Compute transition matrix at several lag times
  Eigenvectors, etc

Example
  We use HTMD which implements the MM machinery (+ building and much more)
  See tutorials on the website

Limitations
  Speed. Writes and reloads an XTC
  Error checking.
  
  
Conclusions 
  Joins two powerful fiels (arbitrary CVs and MMs)...
  by bridging respective state-of-the art implementations
