PLUMED Workshop 2017
==========

Example files for the talk "PLUMED's collective variables in the High
Throughput Molecular Dynamics analysis environment" (T. Giorgino).

The [slides](slides/giorgino.pdf) for this talk are in the *slides* 
directory and on the [PLUMED 2017 Workshop's repository](https://github.com/plumed/trieste2017).

The files are meant to show the object model for Plumed 2's collective
variables in HTMD. They are ordered roughly in the direction of increasing
complexity.

The examples are meant to be illustrative, not to give converged results!

To download and install HTMD, see www.htmd.org. You may need to get
the development version from GitHub (override with PYTHONPATH),
possibly switching to the "toni-devel-plumed" branch until last-minute
changes are merged.
