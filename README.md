PLUMED Workshop 2017
==========

Example files for the talk "PLUMED's collective variables in the High
Throughput Molecular Dynamics analysis environment" (T. Giorgino).

The files are meant to show the object model for Plumed 2's collective
variables in HTMD. They are ordered roughly in the direction of increasing
complexity.

The examples are meant to be illustrative, not to give physically
correct results!
